# appHub Certificate Importer

## About

This simple batch program asks for permission elevation, then imports the root certificate for AppHub (primarily for the Windows Store installation file, but also for certain downloads)<br>
It is not malicious, although AV engines might flag it as such. This is because it imports a certificate. It just imports the certificate at [/default.cer](./default.cer) and then exits.<br>
